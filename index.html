                Two students from Stanford University wanted to make internet searching more organized and efficient.
                With that idea, students Larry Page and Sergey Brin bore what is now <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span></i>. Their idea was officially founded on September 4, 1998.
                At first their project was named "Backrub" but later changed it to <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span></i> as a play on the mathematical symbol, the "googol."
                Page and Brin soon received their first investment for <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span></i>. Andy Bechtolsheim wrote a check for $100,000 to the two.
                Not long after, Page and Brin moved out of Stanford and began <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span></i> inside of their friend's garage.
                The domain of <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span></i>.com was bought and their company was offically incorporated. They began hiring employees and by March of 1999,
                they moved into a real office in Palo Alto, California. Three months later, they recieved a major investment of $25 million
                from the venture firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers as well as from Sequoia Capital. In August of that year, the company
                outgrew their office in Palo Alto and moved to one in Mountain View, only a few miles from where their idea for <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span></i>
                began, Stanford University. In October of 2000, the company began selling ad spaces through <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span></i> AdWords. The revenue from the ad sales
                thrusted <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span></i> into being one of the richest companies in the world. In 2001, Eric Schmidt joined as the chairman and was named <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span></i>
                CEO. Brin and Page were also named presidents of the company. Schmidt brought leadership qualities that helped boost <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span></i> to the top.

            <li><b>2004: <span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">m</span><span id="yellow">a</span><span id="blue">i</span><span id="green">l</span></b></li>
            <p>
                Google launched <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">m</span><span id="yellow">a</span><span id="blue">i</span><span id="green">l</span></i> on Thursday, April 1, 2004. Google decided to compete with Microsoft's email service, Hotmail.
                The project was originally named Caribou. The thought of <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">m</span><span id="yellow">a</span><span id="blue">i</span><span id="green">l</span></i> was devised in the mid-1990s. However, the HTML code that was created was much slower and
                cumbersome than what <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">m</span><span id="yellow">a</span><span id="blue">i</span><span id="green">l</span></i> came out to be. However, over many years of work and development and a few number of Google employees working on
                project, <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">m</span><span id="yellow">a</span><span id="blue">i</span><span id="green">l</span></i> eventually came to be.<i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">m</span><span id="yellow">a</span><span id="blue">i</span><span id="green">l</span></i> offered 1 gigabyte of storage which was 500 times what Microsoft's Hotmail offered. Many people thought
                the amount of storage was a hoax. <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">m</span><span id="yellow">a</span><span id="blue">i</span><span id="green">l</span></i> became Google's first major landmark service since the search engine debuted in 1998.
                <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">m</span><span id="yellow">a</span><span id="blue">i</span><span id="green">l</span></i> blew Hotmail, Yahoo Mail, and any free electronic mail services provided. <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">m</span><span id="yellow">a</span><span id="blue">i</span><span id="green">l</span></i> was much more advanced than any
                service provided which is why it rocketed to the top. It also offered a search feature that was better than any other email search feature
                offered at the time. Google began its tradition of April Fools' mischief in 2000. The reason many people believed <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">m</span><span id="yellow">a</span><span id="blue">i</span><span id="green">l</span></i> was a hoax
                was because of its release date and unimaginable storage for the time. At first, <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">m</span><span id="yellow">a</span><span id="blue">i</span><span id="green">l</span></i>> was only available through invite. It was only on Valentine's Day
                in 2007 that it was released to the public. It wore its Beta label proudly until they removed it in July of 2009. As time has passed, <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">m</span><span id="yellow">a</span><span id="blue">i</span><span id="green">l</span></i> has still remained to be a major
                competitor in the electronic mail services. <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">m</span><span id="yellow">a</span><span id="blue">i</span><span id="green">l</span></i> is currently the world's most used email service having 1.5 billion users.
