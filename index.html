            <p>
                Two students from Stanford University wanted to make internet searching more organized and efficient.
                With that idea, students Larry Page and Sergey Brin bore what is now <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span></i>. Their idea was officially founded on September 4, 1998.
                At first their project was named "Backrub" but later changed it to <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span></i> as a play on the mathematical symbol, the "googol."
                Page and Brin soon received their first investment for <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span></i>. Andy Bechtolsheim wrote a check for $100,000 to the two.
                Not long after, Page and Brin moved out of Stanford and began <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span></i> inside of their friend's garage.
                The domain of <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span></i>.com was bought and their company was offically incorporated. They began hiring employees and by March of 1999,
                they moved into a real office in Palo Alto, California. Three months later, they recieved a major investment of $25 million
                from the venture firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers as well as from Sequoia Capital. In August of that year, the company
                outgrew their office in Palo Alto and moved to one in Mountain View, only a few miles from where their idea for <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span></i>
                began, Stanford University. In October of 2000, the company began selling ad spaces through <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span></i> AdWords. The revenue from the ad sales
                thrusted <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span></i> into being one of the richest companies in the world. In 2001, Eric Schmidt joined as the chairman and was named <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span></i>
                CEO. Brin and Page were also named presidents of the company. Schmidt brought leadership qualities that helped boost <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span></i> to the top.
