            <p>
                Two students from Stanford University wanted to make internet searching more organized and efficient.
                With that idea, students Larry Page and Sergey Brin bore what is now <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span></i>. Their idea was officially founded on September 4, 1998.
                At first their project was named "Backrub" but later changed it to <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span></i> as a play on the mathematical symbol, the "googol."
                Page and Brin soon received their first investment for <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span></i>. Andy Bechtolsheim wrote a check for $100,000 to the two.
                Not long after, Page and Brin moved out of Stanford and began <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span></i> inside of their friend's garage.
                The domain of <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span></i>.com was bought and their company was offically incorporated. They began hiring employees and by March of 1999,
                they moved into a real office in Palo Alto, California. Three months later, they recieved a major investment of $25 million
                from the venture firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers as well as from Sequoia Capital. In August of that year, the company
                outgrew their office in Palo Alto and moved to one in Mountain View, only a few miles from where their idea for <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span></i>
                began, Stanford University. In October of 2000, the company began selling ad spaces through <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span></i> AdWords. The revenue from the ad sales
                thrusted <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span></i> into being one of the richest companies in the world. In 2001, Eric Schmidt joined as the chairman and was named <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span></i>
                CEO. Brin and Page were also named presidents of the company. Schmidt brought leadership qualities that helped boost <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span></i> to the top.

            <li><b>2004: <span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">m</span><span id="yellow">a</span><span id="blue">i</span><span id="green">l</span></b></li>
            <p>
                Google launched <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">m</span><span id="yellow">a</span><span id="blue">i</span><span id="green">l</span></i> on Thursday, April 1, 2004. Google decided to compete with Microsoft's email service, Hotmail.
                The project was originally named Caribou. The thought of <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">m</span><span id="yellow">a</span><span id="blue">i</span><span id="green">l</span></i> was devised in the mid-1990s. However, the HTML code that was created was much slower and
                cumbersome than what <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">m</span><span id="yellow">a</span><span id="blue">i</span><span id="green">l</span></i> came out to be. However, over many years of work and development and a few number of Google employees working on
                project, <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">m</span><span id="yellow">a</span><span id="blue">i</span><span id="green">l</span></i> eventually came to be.<i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">m</span><span id="yellow">a</span><span id="blue">i</span><span id="green">l</span></i> offered 1 gigabyte of storage which was 500 times what Microsoft's Hotmail offered. Many people thought
                the amount of storage was a hoax. <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">m</span><span id="yellow">a</span><span id="blue">i</span><span id="green">l</span></i> became Google's first major landmark service since the search engine debuted in 1998.
                <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">m</span><span id="yellow">a</span><span id="blue">i</span><span id="green">l</span></i> blew Hotmail, Yahoo Mail, and any free electronic mail services provided. <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">m</span><span id="yellow">a</span><span id="blue">i</span><span id="green">l</span></i> was much more advanced than any
                service provided which is why it rocketed to the top. It also offered a search feature that was better than any other email search feature
                offered at the time. Google began its tradition of April Fools' mischief in 2000. The reason many people believed <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">m</span><span id="yellow">a</span><span id="blue">i</span><span id="green">l</span></i> was a hoax
                was because of its release date and unimaginable storage for the time. At first, <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">m</span><span id="yellow">a</span><span id="blue">i</span><span id="green">l</span></i>> was only available through invite. It was only on Valentine's Day
                in 2007 that it was released to the public. It wore its Beta label proudly until they removed it in July of 2009. As time has passed, <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">m</span><span id="yellow">a</span><span id="blue">i</span><span id="green">l</span></i> has still remained to be a major
                competitor in the electronic mail services. <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">m</span><span id="yellow">a</span><span id="blue">i</span><span id="green">l</span></i> is currently the world's most used email service having 1.5 billion users.

            <li><b>2005 & 2007: <span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span> Maps and <span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span> Earth</b></li>
            <p>
                In 2005, Google launched its new tool aimed at helping users navigate and traverse the real world. Hence, <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span> Maps</i> was created. It combine satellite imagery, real-time driving directions, and global positioning aka GPS.
                In addition to <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span> Maps</i>, Google launced <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span> Earth</i>. <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span></i> Earth was a three dimensional mapping technology that allowed users to see far away locations basically anywhere on the earth from the
                luxury of their own house. The tool was a major success helping with location and time. Through development, extra functions have been added inclusive of visualization of geo-spatial statistics as well as the real time evaluation of site visitors.
                Then in 2007, the version of <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span> Maps</i> was released for the mobile version 2.0. The first version had a beta feature that changed into "My location", which used the GPS or the assisted GPS place of the moblie device.
                2007 also gave way to <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span> Street View</i>. Google strapped a hulking camera to the tops of fleets of cars and sent them out to drive around and record the streets. This was intended to enhance the map and navigation tools. <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span> Street View</i> helps users with storefronts or streetscapes.
                However, Google got in trouble for privacy concerns or questionable footage. <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span> Street View</i> is still availabe to the public despite these concerns. Other features that <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span> Maps</i> offers is a self-selected travel location so if the location does not have an address the user can still set an end point to where they are traveling to.
                Multiple routes are also shown so users can plan according to lenght, time, traffic reports, or for other stops. <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span> Maps</i> also adds information about the location or notable stops along the way. Information includes celebrity-sightings, special events or occasions, or other proper information.
                Real-time traffic reports show if any traffic stop or wreck has occurred so the user can plan accordingly so time is not an issue. <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span> Maps</i> also has a very notable voice.
                The voice of <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span> Maps</i> was orginally Karen Jacobsen. She provided the words used to give directions for <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span> Maps</i>. Later however, <i><span id="blue">G</span><span id="red">o</span><span id="yellow">o</span><span id="blue">g</span><span id="green">l</span><span id="red">e</span> Maps</i> could become synchronized
                with the either iPhone or Android interface to use the phone's recommended voice. The voice could be changed for user preference.
